# Retail Customer Segmentation & Sales Analysis

**Capstone project — IBM SkillsBuild Data Analytics with AI Academic Internship Programme**  
Conducted by BharatCares in association with AICTE  
Submitted by **Aryan Verma**

An end-to-end analysis of 1,067,371 transaction lines from a UK online gift retailer,
answering one question: **which customers is this business actually built on, and which
of them are leaving?**

The analysis segments the customer base with RFM scoring, cross-checks that segmentation
against unsupervised K-Means clustering, estimates customer lifetime value, and measures
retention with an acquisition-cohort matrix — then names the 683 accounts worth
£1.69M that have stopped ordering.

## Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | **Online Retail II** |
| **Link** | **https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii** |
| Direct download | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/502/online+retail+ii.zip |
| Publisher | UCI Machine Learning Repository (dataset 502) |
| Donated by | Dr Daqing Chen, London South Bank University |
| Licence | Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) |
| Size | 45.6 MB zip holding one `.xlsx` workbook of the same size (stored, not compressed) |
| Sheets | `Year 2009-2010`, `Year 2010-2011` |
| Rows | 1,067,371 across both sheets |
| Period | 1 December 2009 to 9 December 2011 |
| Granularity | One row per product line per invoice |

**The dataset is not committed to this repository.** The notebook downloads it from UCI on
first run, extracts it to `data/raw/`, and never modifies it afterwards.  
UCI's throughput varies a lot — the same download measured 31 seconds on one run and several minutes on
another, so allow time for it.

Columns: `Invoice`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `Price`,
`Customer ID`, `Country`. The notebook adds `SourceSheet` and the engineered
`Revenue = Quantity × Price`.

## What the project does

1. **Acquires and profiles the raw workbook** — row counts, missing values, duplicates,
   invoice-prefix distribution, non-product stock codes, negative quantities.
2. **Cleans it with a logged audit trail** — nine steps, each recording the rows and
   revenue it removed and the reason. 96.4% of rows are retained.
3. **Explores the business** — revenue trend and seasonality, new vs returning revenue,
   order processing patterns, products, geography, returns and cancellations, and
   customer concentration.
4. **Segments customers with RFM** — rank-based quintile scoring into nine named
   segments, each with its revenue contribution.
5. **Cross-checks with K-Means** — the same features `log1p`-transformed and
   standardised, `k` scanned from 2 to 8 with inertia and silhouette recorded.
6. **Estimates customer lifetime value** — historical and projected, with the projection
   tested against actual revenue rather than published unchallenged.
7. **Measures retention by cohort** — a monthly acquisition matrix, corrected for
   censoring at both ends of the observation window.
8. **Writes findings, recommendations and limitations** — every number quoted from a
   computed value, and an explicit list of what the data cannot support.

## Key results

| Result | Number |
|---|---|
| Clean revenue analysed | **£20,517,554** across 39,675 orders |
| Identified customers | 5,854 (85.4% of clean revenue is attributable) |
| Revenue from the top 20% of customers | **77.2% of identified revenue** (1,170 customers) |
| Revenue from the top 1% of customers | **31.9% of identified revenue** (58 customers) |
| Champions segment | 1,555 customers (26.6%) → **71.5% of identified revenue** (£12.54M) |
| High-value customers who have stopped ordering | **683 accounts, £1,689,620** |
| Second-year revenue from customers acquired before that year | **82.7%** — but that base *fell* £1,248,022; new cohorts covered the gap |
| Returns | £738,952 = **3.60%** of gross, spiking to 13.30% in January 2011 |
| Administrative credit notes, reported separately | £784,837 — excluded from the return rate because their stock codes are absent from the denominator |
| Largest line in the dataset | £168,469.60 — **cancelled 12 minutes later**, net £0.00 |
| Products whose rank changes net of returns | **7 of the top 10** |
| Christmas-acquired retention at month 3 | **9.3%** vs 22.3% elsewhere — but only 2 cohorts, 402 customers, one season |
| RFM segments that map onto a single K-Means cluster (≥60%) | **9 of 9**; 80.5% of customers land in their segment's modal cluster |

Three of these contradict what a first pass at this dataset produces: the largest "sale"
was a cancellation, so gross product rankings are wrong at the top; the identified base
that supplies 82.7% of second-year revenue *shrank* by £1.25M while the headline grew; and
`InvoiceDate` records back-office keying rather than customer intent, which invalidates any
"best day to advertise" conclusion. Each was found by checking a claim against the data
instead of accepting a plausible number.

Two of the numbers above are deliberately reported with their weaknesses attached rather
than as headlines. The return rate is 3.60% only because the administrative credit notes
are held out of the numerator — count them and the same data gives 7.43%, which is a
different question, not a better answer. And the Christmas retention gap rests on two
cohorts totalling 402 customers whose month-3 window happens to fall in the February–March
revenue trough, so it is a lead to test, not a settled seasonal law. Sections 7.7, 11.2 and
14 of the report state both in full.

## Technologies used

| Tool | Version verified | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.14.6 | Language for the entire analysis |
| Jupyter Notebook | 7.6.2 | Executable document holding code, charts and narrative |
| pandas | 3.0.5 | Loading, cleaning, joining, grouping, cohort pivots |
| NumPy | 2.5.3 | Vectorised arithmetic, `log1p` transform |
| Matplotlib | 3.11.2 | All 14 figures, on one explicit chart theme |
| scikit-learn | 1.9.1 | `StandardScaler`, `KMeans`, `silhouette_score` |
| openpyxl | 3.1.5 | Reads the two sheets of the source workbook |
| python-docx | 1.2.0 | Generates the report from `outputs/facts.json` |

Lower bounds are in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Matplotlib is used rather than an
interactive charting library because an interactive chart does not survive being committed
to a notebook and read by someone else — every figure here is a static image that renders
identically on any machine.

---

## Setup and run

Developed and run on **Python 3.14.6** (Windows 11). The version bounds in
`requirements.txt` are the oldest releases whose APIs the code relies on; only 3.14.6 was
actually exercised.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BU1lDR/retail-customer-segmentation.git
cd retail-customer-segmentation

python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook AryanVerma_RetailCustomerSegmentationAnalysis.ipynb
```

Then run **Kernel → Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**.

Measured run times on the development machine (Windows 11, Python 3.14.6), excluding the
download itself:

| Run | Time |
|---|---|
| First run — parses both `.xlsx` sheets and writes a CSV cache | **1 min 13 s** |
| Every later run — reads the CSV cache | **27 s** |

Deleting `data/online_retail_II.csv` forces the workbook to be re-parsed; doing that
reproduced a byte-identical cache (same SHA-256), so the cache is not a source of drift.
No cell depends on a later cell, so *Run All* from a fresh kernel reproduces every number
and every figure.

To regenerate the Word report from the notebook's outputs:

```bash
python tools/build_report.py
```

The report records a build date, so two runs on different days differ in that one
respect. Pin it and the `.docx` comes out byte-identical — verified by building
twice and comparing SHA-256:

```bash
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000 python tools/build_report.py
```

### Checking the documents still agree with the analysis

```bash
pip install nbformat
python tools/check_docs_drift.py
```

Every file here that states a number is a copy of one in `outputs/facts.json`.
This README quotes them by hand; so do the notebook's markdown cells, which are
typed into `tools/build_notebook.py` and cannot read a runtime value. The `.docx`
and the 1.2 MB of executed cell outputs committed inside the notebook are typed by
nobody, but they are records of the run that produced them, and `facts.json` can be
recommitted from a later one. All four can be wrong while reading as authoritative.
So the check holds all four to `facts.json`: 39 numbers in this README, all 186
facts `build_report.py` reads by name, the notebook's cell sources against its
builder, and 109 anchored figures across the notebook's prose, its committed
outputs and the report.

Anchored means each figure is found by the sentence around it rather than by
matching a number anywhere in the file. A bare number matches by coincidence -- the
notebook says both "18 off-peak cohorts" and "in 18 months" -- and a document that
records its own past mistakes holds stale numbers on purpose. So an anchor that
matches two *different* figures is reported as a failure rather than resolved by
taking the first: section 12.3 quotes the "20 off-peak cohorts" this check exists
to prevent, and an anchor loose enough to bind to that sentence would pass on the
day `facts.json` came to say 20.

It needs no source data and no notebook run -- it reads only committed files,
which is why it can run on every push. The sentence that used to be here credited
the notebook-against-its-builder comparison with catching that stale 20. It cannot
catch it. The notebook is generated from `tools/build_notebook.py`, so a figure
typed wrong in the builder is wrong identically in the `.ipynb`; the two agree and
the check reports clean, which putting the 20 back into both files is enough to
watch it do. What catches it is reading the notebook's prose against `facts.json`,
which is why that comparison now exists.

What it does not check is whether `facts.json` itself is right; that needs the
data. It checks that the documents say what the analysis computed.

### Troubleshooting

* **The download fails or produces a corrupt zip.** Download
  `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/502/online+retail+ii.zip` manually, extract
  `online_retail_II.xlsx`, and place it in `data/raw/`. The notebook detects the cached
  file and skips the download. Do not resume a partial download — a truncated file raises
  `zipfile.BadZipFile`.
* **`ModuleNotFoundError: sklearn`.** The package is `scikit-learn`, not `sklearn` —
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs the right name.
* **`jupyter: command not found`.** The `notebook` package provides the command and is in
  `requirements.txt`; make sure the virtual environment is activated.

### Why the report is generated rather than written

`tools/build_report.py` reads `outputs/facts.json` and `outputs/figures/` and writes
`AryanVerma_ProjectReport.docx`. Nothing in the report is transcribed by hand: change a
cleaning rule, re-run the notebook, re-run the script, and every affected number in the
report updates. The script fails loudly if a fact or a figure it needs is missing rather
than emitting a blank.

This used to be written as "the document cannot drift away from the analysis", which
overstates it by one step. Generated is a fact about the script, not about the file
committed here -- re-run the notebook, commit `facts.json`, skip the third step, and this
repository holds a report that disagrees with the analysis and looks untouched. No
individual number in it is wrong by hand; the whole file is simply older than
`facts.json`. `tools/check_docs_drift.py` reads the committed `.docx` for that reason,
rather than taking the word "generated" as an argument.

## Method notes worth knowing

* **RFM scoring is rank-based.** Frequency is heavily tied — thousands of customers have
  exactly one or two orders — and `pd.qcut` on raw values fails on ties. The notebook ranks
  first (`pd.qcut(x.rank(method="first"), 5, ...)`), which guarantees five populated bands.
* **Recency is measured from a fixed reference date** (the day after the last transaction
  in the file), not from today, so the analysis is reproducible in any future year.
* **Cancellations and write-offs are set aside, not deleted.** A `C`-prefixed invoice is a
  customer return; a negative quantity on an ordinary zero-priced invoice is a stock
  adjustment. Merging the two would overstate the customer return rate. Six `A`-prefixed
  invoices carry −£147,614 of bad debt that the common "drop invoices starting with C"
  recipe leaves in the revenue line.
* **The return rate counts the same population on both sides.** Credit notes are split off
  at cleaning step 3, which is *before* step 7 drops the administrative stock codes — so
  the raw credit-note total still holds reversals of `MANUAL`, `AMAZONFEE`, bank charges,
  discounts and samples. Those codes are absent from the gross-revenue denominator, so
  leaving them in the numerator divides one population by another: £1,523,788 / £20.52M =
  7.43%. Removing them gives £738,952 / £20.52M = **3.60%**, and the £784,837 of
  administrative reversals is reported in its own right instead.
* **Two analysis bases are carried deliberately.** `sales` (all valid revenue lines,
  including guest checkouts) is used for revenue, products, geography and returns;
  `sales_id` (known customer ID only) is used for RFM, K-Means, CLV and cohorts, because
  all four require an identified customer.
* **`k = 4` disagrees with the silhouette metric, and the notebook says so.** The metric
  preferred `k = 2` (0.4376 against 0.3649). Two clusters cannot be marketed to
  differently, so interpretability was chosen over the metric and the cost is reported
  rather than hidden.
* **The 12-month CLV projection is an aggregate upper bound, not a forecast.** Compared
  like for like — projected value for identified customers against the revenue those
  customers actually produced in the second year — it is **2.91×** too high (2.43× against
  the whole revenue line, including the guest checkouts the model never sees, which is the
  more flattering and less meaningful comparison). It also ranks a dormant segment above
  Champions. Every prioritisation decision in the report therefore rests on *historical*
  value, which is measured.

## What this analysis does not support

* **Any pricing or product-mix decision** — the dataset has no cost of goods, so every
  figure is revenue, not margin.
* **Any claim that contacting a customer *causes* a return** — there is no campaign data
  and no experiment in the file, which is why the win-back recommendation specifies a 20%
  untreated control group.
* **Any conclusion about when customers prefer to shop** — the timestamp is a processing
  time, not a purchase time.
* **Using the CLV projection as a forecast.**

The report states all eleven limitations in full, including the attribution gap: 22.9% of
clean sales lines, carrying 14.6% of clean revenue, have no customer ID and are invisible
to every customer-level model here.
