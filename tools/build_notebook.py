"""Build AryanVerma_RetailCustomerSegmentationAnalysis.ipynb from source cells.

Build tooling, not the deliverable: the notebook it writes is. Keeping the cell
sources here means the notebook can be regenerated wholesale instead of edited
cell by cell in the browser, which is what keeps its section numbering and its
narrative consistent.

Usage
-----
    python tools/build_notebook.py     # writes the .ipynb, unexecuted
    python tools/build_notebook.py --check   # compare instead of write
    python tools/run_notebook.py      # executes it in place, reports failures
    python tools/build_report.py      # rebuilds the .docx from the new outputs

Regenerating discards any edit made directly to the .ipynb, so change the cell
sources here rather than the notebook.

That warning used to be the only thing enforcing itself. `--check` compares the
committed notebook's cell sources against the ones here and exits 1 if they have
parted -- so an edit made in the browser is reported on the next push instead of
being silently reverted by whoever regenerates next, possibly months later. It
compares sources only, never outputs: the committed notebook is executed and what
this script writes is not, so anything stricter would fail on every run and get
ignored. tools/check_docs_drift.py calls it.

## 1. Business problem

A UK-based online giftware retailer has two years of transaction history but no
view of *who* its customers are. Marketing spend is undifferentiated: the same
campaign goes to a customer who ordered yesterday and to one who has not ordered
in 18 months. Management wants three questions answered from the data it already
owns:

1. **Where does revenue actually come from** — which products, countries and
   months, and how concentrated is it?
2. **Which customers matter** — can the base be split into a small number of
   groups that deserve genuinely different treatment?
3. **What is a customer worth**, and how much of the base is quietly churning?

## 2. Analytical approach

| Stage | What is done | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Data quality audit | Quantify missing values, duplicates, cancellations, negative quantities, non-product codes | Decide the cleaning rules from evidence, not habit |
| Cleaning | Nine documented steps, each logged with its row and revenue impact | An auditable trail — every number below is traceable to a rule |
| Descriptive analysis | Revenue trend, demand rhythm, products, geography, returns | Establish the baseline the segmentation has to explain |
| Concentration | Pareto curve of revenue by customer | Test whether segmentation is even worth doing |
| RFM segmentation | Recency / Frequency / Monetary quintile scoring → named segments | Transparent, rule-based, directly actionable |
| K-Means clustering | Unsupervised clustering on log-scaled RFM (scikit-learn) | Let the data propose its own groups, then compare against the rules |
| Customer Lifetime Value | Historical value + a rate-based 12-month projection | Turn segments into a budget |
| Cohort retention | Monthly acquisition cohorts × months since first order | Separate a growth problem from a retention problem |

## 3. How to run this notebook

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook AryanVerma_RetailCustomerSegmentationAnalysis.ipynb
```

Run the cells in order. The first data cell downloads the 45 MB source workbook
from the UCI repository if it is not already present and caches a combined CSV,
so the download happens **once**. No API keys, credentials or manual downloads
are needed. Nothing outside this repository folder is written to.

## 4.1 Chart theme

Every chart in this notebook is drawn through one theme so that colour carries
meaning consistently:

* **Categorical palette** — four hues assigned in a fixed order and never
  cycled. The palette was checked for colour-vision-deficiency separation
  (worst adjacent pair ΔE 9.1 under protanopia, against a floor of 8) so the
  series stay distinguishable for red–green colourblind readers.
* **Sequential ramp** — a single hue, light to dark, used for magnitude
  heatmaps. Never a rainbow, because a rainbow implies an order that hue does
  not have.
* Grid lines are hairline and recessive; there are no dual-axis charts, and no
  pie charts. Every chart is accompanied by the table it was drawn from, so no
  value is readable only by eye.

Repository: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii>

It is a real transaction log from a UK-registered, non-store online retailer
selling giftware, mostly to wholesalers. The workbook holds **two sheets, one
per trading year**; both are loaded and concatenated, with a `SourceSheet`
column kept so the two years remain separable.

The cell below is idempotent — it uses the cached CSV if present, then the
extracted workbook, and only downloads from UCI as a last resort. The original
downloaded files are never modified.

**What the code table shows.** Three genuinely different things are mixed
together under `StockCode`:

1. **Service charges** — `DOT` (Dotcom postage), `POST`, `C2`/`C3` (carriage)
   and the `GIFT_0001_*` vouchers. These are money a real customer really paid,
   but they are not merchandise. They belong in revenue and in customer value;
   they must be excluded from *product* rankings.
2. **Administrative entries** — `AMAZONFEE`, `B` (bad-debt adjustment), `M`
   (manual), `BANK CHARGES`, `D` (discount), `CRUK` (charity commission),
   `S` (samples), `ADJUST`, `TEST001`/`TEST002`. Every one of these is either a
   cost, a correction or a test. They are not sales at all and are removed.
3. **Real products with non-standard codes** — the `DCGS*` range (dog collars,
   bags, ashtrays), `SP1002`, `PADS`. These stay, and stay counted as products.

The invoice prefixes matter for the same reason. Cancellations are not the only
reversal in the file: six `A`-prefixed invoices carry bad-debt write-offs worth
−£147,614. The standard recipe for this dataset — "drop the rows whose invoice
starts with C" — leaves every one of them in the revenue line.

This is why the audit came before the cleaning. A blanket "drop everything whose
stock code is not five digits" rule would have thrown away real merchandise, and
a blanket "keep everything" rule would have let a −£260,763 Amazon fee sit in the
revenue line. In particular, `M` (*Manual*) shows a large **positive** figure if
only positive quantities are counted, but its true net across all rows is
**negative** — it is a bidirectional correction code, and reporting it as a
top-selling "product" would be an outright error.

Nine steps, each one logged with the rows and revenue it removes. The log is the
audit trail: any figure later in this notebook can be traced back to the rule
that produced the population it was computed on.

The design decision worth stating explicitly: **cancellations and write-offs are
set aside, not deleted.** They are analysed in their own right in section 10.
Deleting a return destroys the information that the return happened.

The gap between the **mean** order value and the **median** is the first real
finding. The mean sits far above the median, which means order value is
right-skewed: a small number of large wholesale orders pulls the average up
while the typical order is much smaller. Any plan built on "the average
customer" would be planning for a customer who does not exist — which is the
case for segmentation in one line.

after the one they were first seen in, including months later in the same year they

**One Saturday in twenty-five months.** Saturday is not merely quiet — all 30
Saturday orders in the entire dataset fall on a *single date*, 5 December 2009,
so every other Saturday in the window carries zero orders. Sunday, meanwhile,
processes 4,826 orders at weekday-like volumes.

A customer base that trades every Sunday but only one Saturday in 25 months does
not exist. That pattern cannot describe customer behaviour, so `InvoiceDate` must
record **when an order was keyed into the system by staff**, not when the
customer decided to buy. The lone Saturday is most likely a catch-up session
during the pre-Christmas peak.

Two consequences follow, and they point in opposite directions. Any "best day to
advertise" conclusion drawn from this column would be an artefact of the office
rota and is worthless. The same column *is* reliable for operations: it shows
genuine back-office load, so warehouse and support staffing should follow the
weekday 10:00–15:00 concentration, which accounts for the large majority of all
order processing.

# 11. RFM segmentation

**RFM** scores each customer on three behaviours that are known to predict
future purchasing better than demographics:

* **Recency** — days since the last order. A customer who bought last week is
  worth more than one who bought 18 months ago.
* **Frequency** — number of distinct orders placed.
* **Monetary** — total revenue generated.

Each dimension is cut into quintiles and scored 1–5. Recency is scored in
reverse (fewer days = better). Quintiles are taken on **ranks** rather than raw
values, because frequency is heavily tied — thousands of customers placed
exactly one order — and tied values would otherwise collapse the bin edges.

The reference date is **one day after the last transaction in the log**, so that
the most recent customers get a recency of 1 rather than 0. Using today's date
would make every customer look churned, since the log ends in 2011.

# 12. K-Means clustering on RFM

The RFM segments above come from rules **I** wrote. A clustering algorithm is
given no rules and proposes its own groups from the shape of the data. Running
both and comparing them is the useful move: agreement is evidence the structure
is real, and disagreement shows where the rules are arbitrary.

Two preparation steps matter:

* **Log transform.** Recency, frequency and monetary value are all heavily
  right-skewed. K-Means minimises squared Euclidean distance, so without a
  transform a handful of wholesale accounts would dominate every centroid.
  `log1p` compresses the tail while preserving order.
* **Standardisation.** Monetary is measured in thousands of pounds and frequency
  in single orders. Unscaled, monetary would be the only feature that counts.

### 12.1 Choosing k honestly

The silhouette score is highest at the smallest k on the scan. That is the
normal behaviour of this metric on continuous, single-blob behavioural data: it
rewards splitting the cloud in half because that maximises the separation
between two centroids, not because two groups are the right answer for a
marketing team. Two groups — "buys" and "buys less" — cannot be acted on.

**k = 4 is adopted**, for two stated reasons: it is where the elbow curve stops
falling steeply, and four is the practical ceiling on the number of distinct
campaign treatments this business could actually run. Its silhouette score is
reported below alongside the k = 2 figure so the trade-off is visible rather
than hidden. This is a judgement call, and it is labelled as one.

# 13. Customer Lifetime Value

Two figures are reported, and the difference between them matters:

1. **Historical CLV** — revenue the customer has actually generated. A fact.
2. **Projected 12-month value** — the customer's observed revenue *rate*
   extended forward one year, i.e.
   `monthly rate x 12`, where the rate is total revenue divided by observed
   active tenure.

The projection is a **constant-rate assumption**, not a probabilistic forecast.
It assumes a customer keeps buying at the pace already observed, which is
optimistic for a dormant customer and conservative for one that is accelerating.
A production model would use BG/NBD plus a Gamma-Gamma spend model to put a
churn probability on each account; that is named in the limitations rather than
silently skipped. Customers with a tenure under 30 days are floored at one month
so that a single large first order does not project to an implausible annual
figure.

### 14.1 The first cohort is not an acquisition cohort

The December 2009 row deserves suspicion rather than celebration. It is both the
**largest** cohort and by far the **best-retaining** one — its reorder rate holds
in the 33–50% band for the whole of the following year, against a month-1 average
of 20.8% for every cohort that follows it. A cohort that sustains roughly twice the base rate
is not a marketing success; it is an artefact.

The cause is **left-censoring**. The log begins on 1 December 2009, so a customer
who had been buying from this retailer for years appears in the data for the first
time that month and is classified as "newly acquired". The December 2009 cohort is
therefore not new customers at all — it is *the entire pre-existing customer base*,
observed for the first time. Established customers retain well, which is exactly
what the row shows.

Two figures reported above inherit this bias and are recomputed below without that
row: the average retention curve, and the correlation between cohort size and
retention.

# 15. Key findings

Every figure below is computed by the cells above and stored in
`outputs/facts.json`. Nothing here is estimated or rounded from memory.

### 1. Revenue is extremely concentrated — segmentation is justified before it is built

**1,170 customers (20%) generate 77.2% of identified revenue. The top 58
customers (1%) generate 31.9%.** Both shares — like every customer-level share
below — are measured against the £17.53M carried by identified customers, not the
£20.52M total. The median customer is worth £889 and the mean £2,994 — the
mean is 3.4x the median, so "the average customer" is a fiction. Order value
tells the same story: a £517.14 mean against a £303.85 median.

This is the finding that licenses everything after it. Uniform treatment of this
base is guaranteed to be wrong, because it is calibrated to a customer who does
not exist.

### 2. One segment holds 71.5% of identified revenue, and one holds the risk

**Champions — 1,555 customers, 26.6% of the base — account for £12.54M, or 71.5%
of all identified revenue.** At the other end, 945 *Lost* and 714 *Hibernating*
customers (28.3% of the base together) contribute 3.4% between them.

The urgent group is neither: **683 customers in *Cannot lose them* and *At risk*
have already spent £1.69M (9.6% of identified revenue) and have stopped
ordering.** These
are not low-value customers who drifted away — they are proven buyers who went
quiet, and they are the only group where an intervention has a large, identified
prize attached.

### 3. The two largest "sales" in the dataset were never sales

**The single biggest line in 1.07M rows — 80,995 units of *Paper Craft, Little
Birdie*, £168,469.60 — was cancelled 12 minutes after it was raised**, on the
final day of the log. Net contribution: **£0.00**. The second largest line
(74,215 ceramic storage jars, £77,183.60) was also cancelled in full.

The consequence is not academic. Ranked on gross revenue, that product is the
retailer's **4th** best seller. Ranked net of cancellations it is **4,711st** of
4,725. **Seven of the top ten products change position once returns are netted
off.**
Any product report built on gross sales — the default in most tutorials on this
dataset — is materially wrong at the top of the table.

### 4. Returns cost £738,952, and the aggregate rate hides the problem

Customer returns total **£738,952 across 18,467 lines — 3.60% of gross revenue**,
taking £20.52M down to a net £19.78M. The monthly rate averages 2.99% but is not
stable: it **spikes to 13.30% in January 2011**, immediately after the Christmas
peak.

The credit notes set aside in step 3 come to £1,523,788, but £784,837 of that is
administrative — £423,873 of `MANUAL` adjustments, £294,773 of `AMAZONFEE`,
£36,097 of bank charges, plus discounts, charity lines and samples. Step 7 removes
those stock codes from the revenue base, so counting them as returns would divide
one population by another and roughly double the apparent rate. They are reported
separately in section 9 rather than folded in.

Returns are a post-seasonal event, not a constant leak, so a single annual
return-rate assumption will under-provision January and over-provision the rest
of the year.

### 5. The business is one country and one quarter

**The UK is 85.36% of revenue (£17.51M);** all 42 other markets together make
£3.00M. **September–November averages £1.19M per month against £708,613 for every
other month — a 67.6% seasonal uplift**, peaking at £1.50M in November 2011
against a £521,308 trough in February 2011.

Both concentrations are risks, but the export data also contains an opportunity
that the revenue ranking hides: **the Netherlands averages £2,484.46 per order
against the UK's £483.27 — 5.1x** — on a small number of orders. The export
markets are low-volume and high-value, which is a different business from the
domestic one and probably deserves different handling.

### 6. The existing base carries the revenue but shrank; new customers covered the gap

On all revenue, like-for-like years grew **8.1%** (£9.56M to £10.32M). Underneath
that, two different questions get confused, so both are answered on the identified
base. **Repeat buying dominates the level:** across the twelve full months from
December 2010 to November 2011, **91.3% of identified revenue came from customers
who had already ordered in an earlier month.** Only 8.7% came from customers in
their very first month.

**Acquisition, not retention, produced the growth.** Splitting the same window by
acquisition cohort, identified revenue went from £8,384,041 to £8,627,354 — a rise
of just **£243,313 (+2.9%)** — and it breaks down as **+£1,491,334 from customers
first acquired during year 2, against a £1,248,022 decline in the year-1 base.**
Customers acquired before year 2 still supplied 82.7% of year-2 revenue, but they
supplied less of it than the year before.

So the existing base is where the money is, and it is leaking. That is a stronger
reason to care about finding 2's £1.69M at-risk pool than "growth came from
retention" would have been — the decline is already visible in the totals.

### 7. Christmas buys volume, not loyalty

Retention settles at roughly a fifth and then holds: **20.8% at month 1, 21.0% at
month 3, 17.3% at month 6, 18.0% at month 12** (excluding the left-censored first
cohort, and excluding every cell that falls in the file's partial final month). The curve flattens rather than decaying, which is the signature of a
wholesale reorder cycle rather than one-off consumer purchasing.

Splitting cohorts by acquisition month exposes a sharp difference:
**customers acquired in November or December retain at 9.3% by month 3, against
22.3% for customers acquired in any other month — less than half.** The peak
season that produces the revenue spike appears to produce the retailer's worst
customers.

**How thin this one is.** Excluding the left-censored December 2009 row also
excludes the only other December in the file, so the peak side of that comparison
is **two cohorts — November 2010 (n=326) and December 2010 (n=76) — 402 customers,
38 of whom ordered again in month 3** — against 18 off-peak cohorts. All of it comes
from one Christmas. Their month 3 also lands in February and March 2011, the
calendar trough, so part of the gap is weak seasonal demand rather than weak
customers. It is a hypothesis worth a controlled test, not an established
seasonal law — which is why recommendation 5 asks for a test rather than a
reallocation of budget.

### 8. The rules and the algorithm agree, which is the point of running both

K-Means on log-scaled RFM was given no rules, and **every one of the nine
rule-based segments sends at least 60% of its members to a single cluster**.
*Cannot lose them* maps 96.7% onto one cluster and *Lost* maps 98.4% onto
another; the weakest is *Loyal* at 60.9%. At customer level, 80.5% of accounts
sit in their own segment's modal cluster.

What that does and does not prove: the two methods are **not independent
evidence in the strong sense**, because both read the same three R/F/M features
off the same rows. What differs is how the boundaries are drawn — fixed quintile
thresholds against distances in a standardised space. The agreement therefore
shows the structure does not depend on the thresholds chosen, which is the
specific thing worth knowing about a hand-built segmentation.

The honest caveat: the silhouette score preferred **k = 2 (0.4376)** over the
**k = 4 (0.3649)** adopted here. Two clusters cannot be marketed to differently,
so interpretability was chosen over the metric, and the cost is stated rather
than hidden.

### 9. Two data artefacts that would have produced wrong answers

* **`InvoiceDate` is not customer intent.** Every Saturday order in 25 months
  falls on a single date, 5 December 2009 — 30 orders, 0.076% of the total —
  while Sunday processes 4,826 orders at weekday-like volumes. No customer base
  trades every Sunday and only one Saturday in two years. The timestamp records
  back-office keying, so it is valid for staffing (78.1% of orders are processed
  between 10:00 and 15:59, peaking at noon) and worthless for deciding when to
  advertise.
* **Cancellations are not the only reversal.** Six `A`-prefixed invoices carry
  **−£147,614** of bad-debt write-offs. The standard "drop invoices starting with
  C" recipe leaves all of it in the revenue line.

# 16. Recommendations

Each recommendation names the finding it rests on and the number that sizes it.
Where the data cannot support a decision, that is stated instead of guessed.

### 1. Run a win-back on the 683 quiet high-value accounts — and measure it properly

*From finding 2.* These customers have already spent **£1.69M** and have stopped
ordering. Prioritise by **historical** value, not by the projected figure: section
13.1 shows the projection ranks this group *above* Champions, which is an artefact
of the constant-rate assumption, not a real ordering.

Because these are wholesale accounts, the intervention is a phone call from a
named account manager, not a discount email — and the discount is the wrong lever
anyway, since nothing in this dataset says price caused them to leave.

**Hold back a random 20% as an untreated control group.** Without one, any
subsequent recovery is indistinguishable from customers who would have reordered
regardless — and given the flat 18.0% month-12 reorder rate in finding 7, a
meaningful fraction would have.

### 2. Protect the 1,555 Champions before chasing anyone new

*From findings 2 and 6.* Champions produce **71.5% of identified revenue**, and
**82.7% of second-year revenue came from customers acquired before that year
began**. The concentration cuts both ways: losing 58 customers (the top 1%) would
remove **31.9% of identified revenue**.

Concretely: guaranteed stock availability on their repeat lines through the
Sep–Nov peak, and a named contact. The defensive case is not that the existing
base is growing — finding 6 shows it fell by **£1,248,022** in year 2 — it is that
the base still carries five-sixths of the revenue while it declines. Retention
work here defends a larger number than acquisition work adds, and the £1.69M
at-risk pool in finding 2 is where that decline is already visible.

### 3. Stop reporting product performance on gross revenue

*From finding 3.* Seven of the top ten products change rank once cancellations
are netted off, and the gross-rank-4 product is genuinely 4,711th. Every product
report should net cancellations against the original sale.

This is a reporting fix, not a strategy: it costs nothing and it stops the buying
team restocking a line that sold nothing.

### 4. Treat January as a returns event and investigate the top returned lines

*From finding 4.* The return rate hits **13.30% in January 2011** against a 2.99%
average. Two actions follow: provision warehouse and refund capacity for a
post-Christmas spike rather than an even monthly rate, and inspect the
concentrated returned lines in section 9 for a cause — the data shows *which*
products come back but never *why*, so this is a question to take to the
warehouse, not one to answer from the file.

### 5. Change what the Christmas peak is expected to deliver

*From finding 7.* Customers acquired in November–December retain at **9.3% by
month 3 versus 22.3%** otherwise — on two peak cohorts totalling 402 customers
from a single Christmas, whose month 3 falls in the calendar trough.

That evidence supports a **test**, not a budget reallocation. Tag peak-acquired
customers on arrival and measure their month-3 reorder rate against an off-peak
control over the next season; if the gap holds on a second Christmas with the
seasonal effect controlled for, then move acquisition spend out of the peak.
Meanwhile the safe half of this is free: stop counting peak-acquired customers as
new relationships in any target that assumes they behave like the rest of the
base, and run the peak as a volume and cash-generation event.

### 6. Test the export markets deliberately

*From finding 5.* The Netherlands averages **£2,484.46 per order — 5.1x the UK's
£483.27**. That is a striking ratio on a small base, and a small base is exactly
why it must be tested rather than acted on: with £3.00M of export revenue against
£17.51M domestic, a handful of large wholesale accounts could produce this entire
effect.

The recommendation is a bounded test on the highest-AOV markets with a defined
budget, not a market-entry decision. The data supports the hypothesis; it does not
support the investment.

### 7. Fix the 14.6% attribution gap at source

*From the limitations.* **£2.99M of clean revenue — 14.6% of the total, spread
over 22.9% of all sales lines — has no customer ID**, so it is invisible to every
model here. No amount of analysis recovers it —
it is a checkout-and-CRM change, and it raises the ceiling on all future customer
work.

---

### What this analysis does not support

* **Any pricing or product-mix decision.** The dataset has no cost of goods, so
  every figure here is revenue, not margin.
* **Any claim that a campaign *causes* a customer to return.** There is no
  campaign data and no experiment in this file. That is why recommendation 1
  specifies a control group.
* **Any conclusion about when customers prefer to shop** — see finding 9.
* **Using the 12-month CLV projection as a forecast.** Summed across the base it
  is an upper bound on second-year revenue (section 13.1) — for one accelerating
  account the same constant-rate assumption is conservative, so it is not a
  per-account ceiling.

# 17. Limitations

Stating what this analysis cannot support is part of the analysis.

1. **Attribution gap.** 22.9% of clean sales lines (235,813), carrying 14.6% of
   clean revenue (£2.99M), have no customer ID — both shares measured on the same
   cleaned base. Every customer-level result — RFM, clustering,
   CLV, cohorts — is computed on the identified 85.4% only. If guest orders are
   disproportionately one-off purchases, the true repeat rate is lower than
   reported here; if they are unrecognised repeat buyers, several segments are
   undercounted. The data cannot distinguish the two cases.
2. **Revenue, not profit.** The dataset has no cost of goods. Every "value"
   figure here is revenue. A low-margin bestseller and a high-margin niche line
   are indistinguishable in this analysis, so no pricing or product-mix decision
   should rest on it alone.
3. **The CLV projection is demonstrably biased upward, and section 13.1 shows by
   how much.** Summed across the base it exceeds actual second-year revenue by a
   wide margin, and it ranks a dormant segment above Champions. It carries no
   churn probability, so it should be read only as an aggregate upper bound — the
   constant-rate assumption is optimistic for a dormant account and conservative
   for an accelerating one, so it is not a ceiling on any single customer.
   BG/NBD plus a Gamma-Gamma spend model is the correct fix and is not done here;
   prioritisation in section 16 therefore rests on historical value, not on the
   projection.
4. **Censoring at both ends of the cohort matrix.** Cohorts acquired late in the
   window have not had time to show a retention curve, so blank cells on the
   right mean "not yet observable", not "zero". At the other end, the first
   cohort is left-censored: customers who predate the log appear as newly
   acquired in December 2009. Section 14.1 quantifies that bias and reports the
   corrected figures; the uncorrected averages remain in section 14 only so the
   size of the correction is visible.
5. **`InvoiceDate` records processing, not intent.** All 30 Saturday orders in
   the 25-month window fall on one single date, so the timestamp reflects
   back-office keying rather than customer behaviour. No conclusion about *when
   customers want to shop* can be drawn from the hour and weekday columns.
6. **Quintile scoring is relative.** An RFM score of 5 means "top fifth of this
   base", not "good" in absolute terms. Scores are not comparable across a
   different customer base or a different time window.
7. **k = 4 is a judgement call.** The silhouette metric preferred k = 2. Four
   clusters were chosen for operational interpretability, and the metric cost of
   that choice is reported in section 12 rather than hidden.
8. **One retailer, one category, 2009–2011.** A UK giftware wholesaler in the
   post-financial-crisis period. The method transfers; these coefficients do not.
9. **Segments are descriptive, not causal.** Nothing here establishes that a
   campaign *causes* a customer to return. A holdout test would be needed to
   claim that, and this dataset contains no campaign data.
10. **The Christmas retention gap rests on one season.** Excluding the
    left-censored December 2009 row also removes the only other December in the
    file, so the peak side of the 9.3%-versus-22.3% comparison is two cohorts —
    November and December 2010, 402 customers between them, 38 of whom reordered
    at month 3. Their month 3 falls in the February–March trough, so seasonal
    demand and customer quality are confounded and this data cannot separate
    them. Finding 7 is a hypothesis to test, and recommendation 5 is written as
    a test rather than a decision.
11. **The return rate depends on which credit notes count as returns.** The
    3.60% figure counts customer returns of products and carriage only, so that
    its numerator and the gross-revenue denominator describe the same
    population. Including the administrative reversals — manual adjustments,
    Amazon fees, bank charges, discounts, samples — would give 7.43% on
    £1,523,788, but those stock codes are removed from the revenue base by
    cleaning step 7 and are not customers sending goods back. Both numbers are
    reported in section 9; neither is the single "true" rate without saying
    which question is being asked.

### Reproducibility

Every number and every chart in the **outputs** above is computed from the source
data by the cells that produced them, and `outputs/facts.json` records those
computed values. The project report is generated from that file by
`tools/build_report.py`, so no number in it is transcribed by hand.

That is not the same as the report being unable to disagree with the analysis, which
is what this section used to claim. *Generated* describes the script; the `.docx`
committed in the repository describes the run that last produced it. Re-run the
notebook, commit `facts.json`, skip the rebuild, and the repository holds a report
that is perfectly consistent with itself and older than the analysis — no figure in
it wrong on its own, the whole file behind. The cell outputs committed in this
notebook are the same kind of artefact: what one execution printed.

The narrative prose is the third case and the plainest. Figures quoted in markdown
cells — like the cohort counts in 11.2 — are typed, not interpolated, because a
markdown cell cannot read a runtime value. One of them was wrong for some while:
this notebook said the Christmas comparison ran against 20 off-peak cohorts where
`facts.json` and the generated report both said 18. The report was right, because it
had no choice.

So: trust the outputs, and treat a number in the prose as a claim that `facts.json`
settles. `tools/check_docs_drift.py` does that now, figure by figure, across this
notebook's markdown, its committed outputs, the `.docx` and the README. This
paragraph used to credit the comparison between this notebook and
`tools/build_notebook.py` with having caught that 20, which is something that
comparison cannot do: the notebook is generated from that file, so a figure typed
wrong there is wrong identically here, the two agree, and the check reports clean.
